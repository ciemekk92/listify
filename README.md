#### Author: Przemys≈Çaw Reducha

## Tech stack

-   React 16.13
-   Typescript
-   React Router
-   React Transition Group
-   Redux
-   Styled Components
-   Firebase

## How to run:

1. Try the live demo https://listify-react.firebaseapp.com/
2. Download / clone the repository and run `npm install` in the downloaded directory to install all dependencies and then run `npm run start`.

Note: Cloning the repository will require:

1.  Configuring Firebase to work correctly and storing API key, messaging sender ID and App ID in `.env` file in root directory.
2.  Editing `./firebase/firebase.ts` file with the rest of your Firebase account's config info.

## TODO

-   Tests
-   Split components to follow SRP, check project for DRY accordance.
